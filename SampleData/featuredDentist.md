	dentists_specialty: Endodontist - Root Canal Specialist
	dentists_description:If your tooth’s pulp becomes infected or the interior of your teeth becomes otherwise damaged or diseased, your general dentist will probably refer you to a dental specialist called an endodontist. Like unassuming superheroes, endodontists specialize in saving the day - er, I mean saving your teeth. Inside our teeth are tiny cavern-like passages called canals that contain sensitive pulp, blood vessels, and nerves. An endodontist is a type of dentist who diagnoses and treats problems within this sensitive interior. Endodontists diagnose tooth pain and, in many cases, perform root canals on diseased teeth

	dentists_specialty:Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon
	dentists_description:This dental specialty treats problems related to the hard and soft tissues of your face, mouth, and jaw. You don’t need this type of dental specialist for every kind of oral surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons perform more complex procedures or procedures requiring deep levels of sedation beyond nitrous oxide or laughing gas. In fact, oral surgeons are the only health care professionals, other than anesthesiologists, who administer all levels of sedation. Specialized procedures performed by oral surgeons include tooth extractions, corrective jaw surgery, and cleft lip or cleft palate surgery.

	dentists_specialty:Orthodontist - Alignment Specialist
	dentists_description:An orthodontist is a dental specialist who corrects the position of your teeth and jaws. You might see this type of dental specialist if you have an overbite, underbite or crossbite caused by a misaligned jaw. Orthodontist also correct crooked or misaligned teeth. In these situations, an orthodontist uses braces, clear aligners, palatal expanders, or headgear as part of your treatment plan. Children often see this type of dental specialist, but as adult braces and other alignments become more routine, people of all ages now commonly see orthodontists. Whether you seek orthodontic treatment for yourself or your child, check your dental insurance coverage first so you know what to expect in terms of any out-of-pocket costs. Also, some plans require a referral from your primary dentist before receiving orthodontic treatment, so contact your dental insurance provider about this as well.",

	dentists_specialty:Pediatric Dentist
	dentists_description:A pediatric dental specialist is to a child’s oral health like a pediatrician is to their physical health. Pediatric dentists specialize in the oral development and dental care of children from infancy through their teens. A pediatric dentist helps your child stay on the path to a lifelong, healthy smile. Most general dentists also treat children, but parents often choose a pediatric dental specialist for their children’s routine dental care because of their kid-friendly practices and age-specific knowledge. Pediatric dental specialists provide routine care like exams, cleanings, and cavity fillings, but they are also great resources for kid-specific issues like (groan) thumb sucking. Pediatric dentists also specialize in diagnosis of oral conditions associated with diseases like childhood diabetes. This dental specialist monitors the development of your child’s smile and recommends other dental specialists, like orthodontists, when needed.
